# Nixos Configuration for personal purpose

I'm a software developer and this is my whole Nixos configuration. It includes home-manager for managing dot-files. 

There are not any installation instructions because you already know what will you do ;)

You can follow me at twitter.com/delirehberi and also you can ask me when you need assistance to use that configuration.
